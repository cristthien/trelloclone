### Git rules
+ Must not push code to branch master/main, push and create pull request from branch feature to branch develop.
+ Commit and push code to github from 7 A.M to 11 P.M, pull request after this time will be checked in next day.
+ Fetch code before coding new feature.
+ Each feature create a brand new branch.
+ Must not merge code.
### Git & Working flow
#Step 1: Clone Project
> git clone https://github.com/cristthien/trelloclone.git

#Step 2: Check local Git branch & remote Git branch.

> git branch -a

#Step 3: Fetch code from remote to local before working.
> git fetch origin develop


#Step 4: Checkout to develop branch.
> git checkout develop

[IMPORTANT] From this, every push and create pull request event will be pushed only to branch develop, must not work with master/main branch (this branch will store lasted stable state of project).

#Step 5: Checkout from branch develop to branch feature to working with your feature.
[IMPORTANT] Every push and create pull request event will be pushed only to branch develop, must not work with master/main branch (this branch will store lasted stable state of project).
> git checkout -b feature/tasks_name

#Step 6: [IMPORTANT] When everything have done, check status, test every parts of project from beginning flow of application.
> git status

#Step 7: Affter testing, add all files have change and commit.
> git add .

> git commit -m 'What are added, changed, removed, name of feature'

#Step 8: Push from local to remote
> git push origin [Name of branch that you are working]

if you just clone project, try:

> git --set-upstream origin [Name of branch that you are working]

this command will set up a tracking relationship between local and remote repo



#Step 9: Access Github.com and create pull request

#Step 10: Check branch have pushed or not. If anything go wrong you can't not see your branch as remote branch
> git branch -a

#Step 11: Before want to begin new section, ask Duong Tung check everything before update code
> git fetch --prune

Check all branch again
> git branch -a

If you see branch feature/name_of_your_branch is deleted, your code is accepted and merged to Develop. If anything wrong with that code you will receive email with comments.

#Step 12:Checkout Develop, pull newest code and repeat the process
> git checkout develop

> git pull
